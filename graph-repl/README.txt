Hello. This is a final project by Will Harris for the CSCI 360 Programming Languages cource taught by Professor Yorgey.
The idea for the project was to create a graphing calculator, allowing the user to input an arithematic expression and make a graph based off of what expression they typed in.
Having the program draw something proved to be a challenge. To summarize what it needed to do, it needed to generate a list of points using the bounds given and the function. From there, they input the x-coordinates and return y-coordiantes into a point. From there, those points are fed into polyline.
Another challenge was having the user defined bounds in the expression, which proved difficult in facilitating the syntax moreso than actually using those bounds. It took a while, and some time learning about parsing in Haskell, before I was able to get this syntax to work: [0,10]:x+1. Inputtting that should give a valid drawing the program will draw on graph.png.
The main file in charge of the drawing and calculating is located in Graphs.hs.
In order to use this calculator or build upon it, you will need to install Rasterific. http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Rasterific-0.7.5.3/docs/Graphics-Rasterific.html The file uses this module to draw the graphs using the polyline function and Point data constructor.
